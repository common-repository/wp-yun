Use Yun generated short links for all your WordPress posts and pages, including custom post types.


== Description ==

WP Yun is the easiest way to replace the internally generated WordPress short links with Yun generated short links.

Provide WP Yun with an authorization token (automatically generated for you by Yun), tell it which post types you'd like to generate short links for, and forget about it! WP Yun does the rest for you.

Short links are a great way to quickly share posts on social media like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Just finished writing an amazing post and want to share that post with your friend? It's a lot easier to text message a shortlink than the entire address.

WP Yun also provides some insights (via a metabox on your edit post screen) as to how your link is being passed around. there is also a link to update shortlink and clicks statistics.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installation, do I need to update all my posts for short links to be created? =

No. The first time a shortlink is requested for a particular post, WP Yun will automatically generate one.

= What happens if I change a posts permalink? =

WP Yun will verify the shortlink when it's requested and update as necessary all on its own.

= Can I include the shortlink directly in a post? =

Sure can! Just use our handy dandy shortcode `[wpyun]` and shazam! The shortcode accepts all the same arguments as the_shortlink(). You can also set "post_id" directly if you wish.

= How do I include a shortlink using PHP? =

`<?php wp_yun_short_link(); // shortcode shweetness. ?>`

*(You don't have to include the php comment, but you can if you want.)*
